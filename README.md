# NucleusBot
[NucleusBot](https://www.nucleus.bot/bot) is a cross-platform cloud-hosted stream bot. This repository serves as a tracker for bot related issues.

# Operation
NucleusBot operated as two separate applications, the website (Accessible from www.nucleus.bot) and the "bot" application.

# Website
[The Website](https://www.nucleus.bot/) is the portal for controlling and operating the bot part of the application, which is otherwise only accessible using chat commands.

The website provides a simple easy-to-use interface for operating the application without having to memorize any commands.

# Bot
The bot portion of the application takes in commands from chat (such as stream chat or communication applications) as well as from the dashboard portion of the website.

This portion of the application is responsible for all interactions with stream chat, such as chat commands and minigames.
